You may execute this code by going this compiler:- https://cpp.sh/

Sorry for not being able to share file.exe file as my Visual Studio Code is not compatible with this code as it uses C++14 but the header file I used to write this program can be only used in version C++17 or newer. I tried a lot but VS code is not updating to C++17 so I had no other choice other than to use that Online Compiler.

I would recommend to switch to C++17 on Online compiler to run this code. Otherwise it won't run.
